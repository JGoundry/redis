# C++ Redis Server Implementation

This project provides a basic implementation of a Redis-like server built with C++.

It implements a TCP server that communicates using the **RESP2 (REdis Serialization Protocol version 2)**.

The primary focus of this project is purely educational, aiming to demonstrate core networking concepts, RESP2 encoding/decoding, command parsing, and in-memory data storage.

**Please note: This is a simplified implementation and is not intended for production use.**
